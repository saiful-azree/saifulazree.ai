# Hello, I'm Saiful Azree 👋

I am a **Computer Engineering** student specializing in **Computer Vision**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Embedded Systems**. My passion lies in creating "intelligent eyes" for machines, developing algorithms that allow technology to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world in real-time.

## 🚀 My Engineering Journey
It started when I was in Form 4 when I chose to take the **physical science stream** after sitting for the PT3 exam. Between the physical science stream and the pure science stream, both have physics and chemistry subjects. However, the physical science stream does not have biology subjects, instead the stream has technical communication graphics (engineering drawings) and sustainability basics subjects for SPM.

After sitting for SPM and finishing secondary school, I continued my studies at Pahang Engineering Matriculation (KMKPh) for one year. This is my first time living in dormitory and I learned a lot of things while I was here. At this time, engineering matriculation colleges combine three types of engineering **(civil engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering)** in one module.

After completing my studies at KMKPh, I chose Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM) to continue my studies for a bachelor's degree in 2021. The program I took at UTeM is **Bachelor of Computer Engineering with Honours** and my study period there was 4 years. When I first entered UTeM, my faculty name was Fakulti Kejuruteraan Elektronik dan Kejuruteraan Komputer (FKEKK) but then it was changed to Fakulti Teknologi dan Kejuruteraan Elektronik dan Komputer (FTKEK).

## 🛠️ Technical Expertise
I bridge the gap between high-level AI research and low-level hardware implementation:

* **Computer Vision:** Expertise in object detection (YOLOv8/v9), facial expression recognition (CNNs & Transformers), and image preprocessing with OpenCV.
* **Embedded Systems:** Hands-on experience deploying models on STM32H7, NodeMCU ESP8266, and Raspberry Pi.
* **AI Frameworks:** Proficient in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras for training and optimizing neural networks.
* **Optimization:** Skilled in TinyML, model quantization, and using STM32Cube.AI to adapt models for resource-constrained environments.
