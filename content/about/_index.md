# Hello, I'm Saiful Azree 👋

I am a **Computer Engineering** student specializing in **Computer Vision**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Embedded Systems**. My passion lies in creating "intelligent eyes" for machines, developing algorithms that allow technology to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world in real-time.

## 🚀 My Engineering Journey

It started in Form 4 when I chose to take the **physical science stream** after sitting for the PT3 exam. Between the physical science stream and the pure science stream, both have physics and chemistry subjects. However, the physical science stream does not have biology subjects, instead the stream has technical communication graphics (engineering drawings) and sustainability basics subjects for SPM.

After sitting for SPM and finishing secondary school, I continued my studies at Pahang Engineering Matriculation.

## 🛠️ Technical Expertise
I bridge the gap between high-level AI research and low-level hardware implementation:

* **Computer Vision**: Expertise in object detection (YOLOv8/v9), facial expression recognition (CNNs & Transformers), and image preprocessing with OpenCV.
* **Embedded Systems**: Hands-on experience deploying models on STM32H7, NodeMCU ESP8266, and Raspberry Pi.
* **AI Frameworks**: Proficient in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras for training and optimizing neural networks.
* **Optimization**: Skilled in TinyML, model quantization, and using STM32Cube.AI to adapt models for resource-constrained environments.

## 💡 Beyond the Code: Mentorship & Impact
I believe that engineering excellence is best shared. Through the **SULAM initiative**, I served as a technical mentor for students at **Sekolah Menengah Teknik Melaka**. Leading workshops on Smart Waste Management taught me how to translate complex technical concepts into accessible knowledge—a skill I carry into every collaborative project.

## 🎯 Current Focus
I am currently exploring the intersection of **Vision Transformers (ViT)** and **Real-Time Embedded Systems**. My goal is to contribute to the next generation of autonomous systems, specifically in the fields of precision agriculture and mental health monitoring technology.
